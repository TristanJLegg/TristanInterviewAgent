## Summary

I’m a machine learning engineer and master’s graduate with strong expertise in applied machine learning, deep learning, performance optimisation, and building scalable ML systems. I learn quickly and enjoy turning research ideas into robust, high-performance implementations — from custom deep learning frameworks to parallel processing systems.  

I’m curious and adaptable, always staying up to date with the latest AI research, and I enjoy applying cutting-edge methods to real-world challenges. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy collaborating with others to build impactful systems.
