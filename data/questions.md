# What kind of engineer are you?

I am a results-oriented engineer who focuses on rapidly building and shipping AI products that have meaningful impact.

# What are your strongest technical skills?

My strongest skills are rapidly developing projects and writing scalable, modular code.

# What projects or experiences are you most proud of?

I am most proud of building a DQN from scratch in C, where I implemented both the algorithm and environment without external libraries. This gave me strong foundations in deep learning and AI, which continue to support my problem-solving today.

# What do you value in a team or company culture?

I value a culture where everyone works together towards a shared goal and uplifts one another. I also appreciate rapid innovation and adaptability.

# What’s your approach to learning or debugging something new?

I start with a quick crash course and get something simple running. Once I understand the basics, I study the foundations and build on them by implementing or debugging more features.

# How do you usually approach problem-solving?

I first make sure I fully understand the problem and the expected outputs. I then break it down into small steps and solve them one at a time. Afterward, I test edge cases to ensure the solution is solid.

# What programming languages and tools are you most comfortable with?

I am most comfortable with C/C++ and Python. I use PyTorch the most as it gives flexibility and control, which helps with debugging and improving AI algorithms.

# What is something you are currently experimenting with?

I am experimenting with the Gemini CLI, which runs AI agents directly in the terminal. Alongside this, I am building my own terminal-based agent for full-stack web projects using the DeepSeek 7B model.

# How do you stay motivated during long or challenging projects?

I stay motivated by breaking the project into small, manageable chunks and building momentum as I complete each one.

# What kind of projects excite you the most?

Projects that are innovative while still being delivered in a timely manner.

# How do you ensure your code is reliable and maintainable?

I keep my code readable, modular, well-named, and tested.

# What’s one non-technical skill you’re particularly proud of?

My curiosity, as it drives me to learn deeply and explore new ideas.

# How do you balance creativity with structure in your work?

I allow room for creativity while ensuring the work still meets its goals.

# Which areas of AI or engineering are you most eager to explore further?

I want to dive deeper into deep learning and language models, especially their applications across different fields.

# How do you like to receive and give feedback?

I prefer clear, specific, and constructive feedback, and I give feedback in the same way.

# What’s a time when you had to learn something very quickly?

During my master’s research, I had to quickly learn the basics of 3D graphics with OpenGL to build a fast and adaptable reinforcement learning environment.

# Which frameworks or libraries have you used most in your projects?

I use PyTorch most for machine learning and React for front-end demos.

# How do you usually manage your time and priorities?

I split my work into tasks and schedule time for each one.

# Where do you see yourself in the future?

I see myself leading ambitious AI projects where I can apply my developed technical skills alongside strong leadership abilities.

# How do you approach situations when something doesn’t go as planned?

I look at the issue objectively and try possible fixes. After the project, I review what went wrong and document it to avoid repeating mistakes.

# How do you think about trade-offs between speed and accuracy in AI systems?

I think accuracy and alignment are both the biggest challenges and opportunities in AI. While systems have become cheaper to use, improving these areas is key.

# What role do curiosity and exploration play in your work?

They are essential, as they drive continuous learning and creative problem-solving.

# How do you make sure you’re always improving your skills?

I stay updated on new research and take on side projects to test and grow my abilities.

# What do you usually look for in a mentor or colleague?

Someone experienced, capable, and patient, who can guide and support development.

# What’s a project you’ve done that best represents your way of working?

My master’s thesis, where I built a simple exploratory agent first and then improved it step by step with new architectures and environments.

# How do you handle ambiguity in technical tasks?

I clarify what’s known, seek input when needed, and adapt as I learn more.

# What inspires you most about working in AI right now?

AI feels like the biggest opportunity of my lifetime, with huge potential for impact in all aspects of our life.

# How do you collaborate with people from different backgrounds?

I listen first, respect different perspectives, and work to find common ground.

# How did you get into AI engineering?

I started coding in C# at 14 to make games in Unity. At university, I studied Electronic Engineering to work across both hardware and software. In my final year, a machine learning module was so rewarding it inspired me to pursue a master’s in reinforcement learning.

# How do you define success for yourself in your work?

Success is building and shipping projects with my team and being able to look back on the impact we created.

# What hobbies or activities do you enjoy outside of work?

I enjoy watching soccer, working on programming projects, 3D printing, researching investments, and following current events.

# What’s a book that has influenced you?

I really enjoyed "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". I read it as a teenager. The comedy kept me interested and the futuristic tech made me curious about building technology.

# How do you usually spend your weekends?

I spend time tinkering with my Ender 3D printer and trying new prints. I also watch podcasts and football.

# What’s something you’ve always been curious to learn about?

I still want to learn more about human biology. I studied history instead of biology in school but I see it as an important subject that can help in daily life.

# If you weren’t working in engineering, what other path might you have pursued?

I would probably have pursued a career in finance because I enjoy working with data.
